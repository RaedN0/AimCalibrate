# AimCalibrate

AimCalibrate is a tool designed to help gamers fine-tune their sensitivity settings for hipfire and scoped aiming based on focal length scaling. It allows users to measure their FOV (Field of View) and convert it between different scales.

## Features

- Set up hipfire sensitivity based on cm/360 and DPI.
- Match scoped sensitivity to hipfire sensitivity using focal length scaling.
- Measure your FOV and convert it between different scales.

## Usage

### Setting Up Hipfire Sensitivity

1. Navigate to the "Main Sensitivity" tab.
2. Enter your desired cm/360 and DPI values.
3. Go into your game and use the F1 keybind to turn.
4. Adjust your sensitivity to turn exactly 360 degrees and land at the same spot you started.

### Matching Scoped Sensitivity

1. Navigate to the "Scoped Sensitivity" tab.
2. Enter your cm/360 for hipfire, DPI, hipfire FOV, and scoped FOV.
3. Press F1 to turn while scoping.
4. Adjust your scope sensitivity to turn exactly 360 degrees.

### Measuring Your FOV

1. Navigate to the "Measure FOV" tab.
2. Enter your cm/360 for hipfire, DPI, and hipfire sensitivity.
3. Scope in and line up something at the edge of your screen.
4. Scope out, press F1, move your crosshair to the object you lined up, and press F1 again.
5. Your FOV will be displayed in the textboxes at the bottom. These can also be used to convert your FOV from one scale to the other two.
